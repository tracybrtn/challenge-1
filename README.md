### User Story

        AS A marketing agency
        I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
        SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

### Acceptance Criteria

        GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
          WHEN I view the source code
            THEN I find semantic HTML elements
          WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
            THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning 
          WHEN I view the image elements
            THEN I find accessible alt attributes
          WHEN I view the heading attributes
            THEN they fall in sequential order
          WHEN I view the title element
            THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
